### Hello there! 👋
I am a 1B Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I have a strong passion for **robotics**, **circuits and electronics**, and **game design and development**.

I am an active member on the **Waterloo Aerial Robotics Group (WARG)**, a student design team at the forefront of autonomous drone technology.

In the past, I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from videos games using **Unreal Engine**, to embedded projects using microcontrollers such as **Arduino**. Currently, I am working on Jetboat Racers, a multiplayer boat racing game with thrilling arcade physics.

I am seeking a co-op (internship) for 4 months starting **May 2024**.

Languages 📙:
- C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java

Frameworks 💻:
- React Native, Firebase, Node.js, MongoDB, Arduino
  
Tools 🛠️:
- Git, KiCad, Oscilloscope
- SolidWorks, Autodesk (Fusion 360, Maya, Inventor)
- Adobe (Photoshop, After Effects, Illustrator, Substance 3D Painter), Unreal Engine

Here are some examples of the biggest projects that I have worked on (click on each of them to find out more):
