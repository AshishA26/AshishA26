### Hello there! 👋
I am a 2A Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I have a strong passion for **robotics**, **circuits and electronics**, and **game design and development**.

I am currently an Autonomy Project Manager on the **[Waterloo Aerial Robotics Group (WARG)](https://www.uwarg.com/)**, a student design team at the forefront of autonomous drone technology.

In the past, I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from embedded projects using microcontrollers such as **Arduino**, to videos games using **Unreal Engine**. Currently, I am working on Jetboat Racers, a multiplayer boat racing game with thrilling arcade physics.

Here are some examples of the biggest projects that I have worked on (click on each of them to find out more):
